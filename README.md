## Explanation

Are you tired of hearing people saying things like "Pusheaste ya?" but later thinking "damn, they have a point, the command is in English". 

Now you can change those commands and let the discussion be over. No more excuses. 


## Install 

Add this to your `.gitconfig`, using the your own absolute path to the localized gitconfig file. 

```
[include]
   path = /Users/lucasefe/Code/blackhole/gitconfig-i18n/spanish-gitconfig

```

Now you enjoy the following aliases. You're welcome. 

```
culpar = blame
empujar = push
esconder = stash
estado = status
guardar = stash
rama = branch
tirar = pull
tronco = log
```
